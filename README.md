# Homework 1

Complete functions `DoIt1` and `DoIt2` given in `HMW1.py` such that given a list of integers (`a`), the function returns the number of instances of sequences of 3 integers with the following property: Third integer in the sequence is the summation of the first two integers.

In function `DoIt1` use a standard `for` loop. In `DoIt2` implement the function using **list comprehension**.

Make sure that your code passes all the tests defined in `test_HMW1.py`. (Do not forget to install the pytest extensions.)

Try to make your code as elligant and efficient as possible.
